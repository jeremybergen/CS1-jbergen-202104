    ASCII Art - using literals and variables
    
    Updated By: <Your name> #FIXME1

    This program produces an ASCII art on the console.
    Algorithm steps: 
    1. Use variables to store data/values
    2. Write a series of cout statements to print the data/values

    //FIXME3: declare a variable to store name
    //FIXME4: prompt user to enter their name and store the value in variable
    
    //FIXME5: greet the name using the variable as the following output
    //must output: Nice meeting you, <name>!

    cout << "Hope you like my Tom & Jerry ASCII art...\n\n";

    //FIXME6: use variable to print the second line line of the graphic
    //FIXME7: print the third line of the graphics
    //FIXME8: use variable to print the fourth line
    //FIXME9: use variable to print the fifth line
    //Note: You can add more lines or print more ASCII arts of your choice if you'd like...

    cout << "\nGood bye... hit enter to exit the program: " << '\n';
    //FIXME10: make the console wait for user input
